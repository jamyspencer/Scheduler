-h	Help Menu
-i	Changes the chance that an interrupt will occur(default is 50)
-l	Set log file name(default is test.out)
-m	Changes the number of user processes(default is 18)
-o	Changes the maximum scheduling overhead in nanoseconds(default is 1000)
-q	Changes the base quantum used by processes in nanoseconds(default is 4000000)
-t	Changes the number of seconds to wait until the oss terminates all users and itself(default is 20)

Chance of interrupt must be between 0-100
enter valid file name when using the -l option
the default max users is also the max, enter 1-18
overhead must be between 0-5000000
quantum must be between 0-1000000000
max run time must be greater than 0
